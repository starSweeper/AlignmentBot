"{\"msg_body\": \"*One Shot (Adventures In Testing)*\n_*A Cinderella Tale*_\n*By Amanda Panell*\n\nYesterday after work, I started working on a new Quirk (feature) for Alignment Bot that steals memes from Kacey's Twitter bot and posts them to #memes. I also had to run errands last night and spent some time playing Among Us and just generally slacking off, so I didn't really get anything worth testing until after 10:00 pm. The timeline is important here because Kacey's bot posts at midnight _exactly_. Anyways, I needed an account to test with that I knew would be posting a lot, so I found @Every3Minutes, which posts every 3 minutes to remind people that \"[In the United States] a slave was sold on average every 3.6 minutes between 1820 and 1860.\" Sometimes these posts include images, which was just what I needed. I set up Alignment Bot to listen to that account and patiently refined my code between posts as I waited for one with an image to come in.  Time continued to be the most pressing factor. I made plans in anticipation of the Big Meme Drop. The moment an image was successfully received and reposted, I planned to immediately stop listening to @Every3Minutes and start listening to @rmemes8 and go from posting in the testing channel to posting in #memes.\n\nBut no images were coming in, just text and links to books and articles. I thought something must be wrong with the code I was using, but I double-checked-- the account had simply not posted any images at all since I had told Alignment Bot to start posting in the testing channel. It was about 11:45. Time was running out. I decided the time for risky actions had arrived. I resolved to make the switch to posting in #memes without having tested a single tweet with an image yet. Who knew what errors might occur? But I had to do it. I only had one shot. I could not miss my chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a day. I'd better lose myself to the code. The moment, I'd own it, I'd better not let it go. In other words, I was not throwing away my shot.\n\nAnyways, about that time, my laptop determined that my charger wasn't plugged in quite enough to satisfy it, and it shut itself off. It is a very old laptop. I've had it since my Freshman or Sophomore year at NNU, and I've put it through a lot. It's very slow to start up, and once it's on, it can be a bit unresponsive for a few minutes. By the time I got the laptop back on and had verified that PyCharm was still running my tests, it was 11:52. I told myself I still had time to make the switch. If I avoided any sudden movements and didn't ask too much of my laptop, maybe it would cooperate. I got to work. I needed to get the ID of Kacey's Twitter account and the ID for the #memes channel. The quickest way to get either was online. My laptop was not happy with having to use both PyCharm and Chrome so quickly after startup. I'd scroll through the python file too suddenly, PyCharm would freeze. I'd switch tabs in Chrome, and the whole laptop would excuse itself for a moment. 11:58 was soon here. I was so close. I just had to paste the #memes ID and restart Alignment Bot. Easy, I had time. 11:59 came, I could do it. I stopped the outdated Python Script, and as it reigned itself in, a good 20-30 seconds passed. The clock still said 11:59. I had time; this was it. I pressed run. PyCharm thought long and hard about the idea, decided it was an okay one, and, after a moment or two, it honored my request. I looked at the clock again. It had already struck Midnight.\n\nNO! Had I really failed? That was too painful an idea to accept. Maybe, just maybe, there was a slight delay by Kacey's bot. Perhaps mine had started running just before midnight, as the clock had switched. Maybe Alignment Bot was just slow in posting the meme. Silly Alignment Bot. I waited; seconds passed. The clock threatened to turn to 12:01. Nothing. 12:01 came. It was time to face defeat. I checked Twitter. There it was, a fresh new meme. Posted exactly at midnight, as was foretold. Discouraged, crushed, despondent, I reverted my changes so that I was listening to @Every3Minutes again. STILL, no images came in. Eventually, I went to Twitter to confirm my suspicion that not a single image had been posted for at least an hour now. But this time, I was wrong. An image had been posted. Recently. At exactly midnight.\n\n*TL;DR We were supposed to have a fresh meme delivered last night at midnight, and we don't have it, okay? We just don't.*\", \"user\": \"U011UEZ0EJ0\", \"reactions\": \"{'name': 'glitch_crab', 'users': ['U011CF10FN3'], 'count': 1}\"}"
